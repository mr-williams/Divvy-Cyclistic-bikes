# Divvy-Cyclistic-bikes
## Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project

This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

There are 6 steps to be followed for Data Analytics:
1. Ask:
   
   This phase includes the objective of the project which was to find out how Member & Casual Riders use 
   Cyclistic Bike Share differently which would be used to drive the marketing team on which direction 
   to go in terms of converting their Casual riders in Members.

2. Prepare: 
   
   The data for the project was downloaded from this link provided for the project:
   (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
   The data was organized by monthly basis and was assumed credible since it was published by the 
   organization itself. There were a few anomalies that were addressed. 

3. Process:
   
   The process involved looking for anomalies like Null values and duplicates especially in the columns 
   that affected the trip length. Results that produced negative values were excluded from the table
   which can be found here: divvy_trip_data union.sql.

4. Analyze:
   
   This step invloved creating queries to analyze the data for trends and patterns which would then be 
   converted to visualisations.

5. Share:
   
   The Visualisations for this step were created using Tableau:
